        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I was born in Bethesda, MD.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I lived in Madison, WI while attending UW-Madison, and also in Waco, TX for five years.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I currently live in Charlotte, NC with my wife, dog, and cat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I'm a globetrotting metalhead.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I hope to learn web development and coding to further my career, and one day launch my own business.

        <h2>Interests</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I <em>love</em> training Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. My Professor, <a href="https://www.bjjheroes.com/bjj-fighters/lucas-lepri-wiki-bio" target="_blank">Lucas Lepri</a>, has his HQ academy here in Charlotte.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I've traveled throughout the Americas and Europe to attend metal shows and festivals. Finding new bands and albums is a lot of fun, and it's easy to do using <a href="https://www.metal-archives.com" target="_blank">Metal Archives</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I love craft beer and the variety of styles we have in the U.S. Fun fact: Asheville, NC, has the highest number of breweries per capita in the country! <a href="https://burialbeer.com/" target="_blank">Burial Beer Co.</a> is my favorite NC brewery.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I started a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/metalbrewz/" target="_blank">curated Instagram</a> earlier this year during quarantine boredom to combine my interest in metal and craft beer, and share it with people.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Gaming is one of my oldest and most favorite hobbies. Been playing Modern Warfare obsessively for this past year; let's squad up in Warzone if you play, too!
                </li>
            </ul>

        Here's a sample of a recent post from my metal and beer Instagram! Don't worry, it's all instrumental.
